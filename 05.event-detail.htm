This exhibition seeks to examine some of the unheard stories and unheard voices of a generation of artists and designers placed curiously in a spot between two cultures. These designers all have some kind of connection to Korea and this project seeks to identify where and how these connections can give insight to contemporary Korea.
<br></br>
This exhibition seeks to examine some of this phenomenon and also present a platform for some of these identities, voices and stories to be heard and told.This project has invited some intriguing individuals from around the world who all are in some way connected to Korea and Korean design and art. It is a grand experiment that seeks to tell these stories through the language and typography of Hangul.The theme is Korea. The unifying thread visually, conceptually, and ideologically is Hangul.
<br></br>
The bridge in which these connections will unveil themselves will begin with shit. It appears as cartoon like characters, childrens books, names of places and can be found in a plentiful assortment of Korean proverbs. By focusing on the language and metaphorical aspects in proverbs of shit, a ripe perspective of visual analysis and insight may occur in many possible interpretations.
<br></br>
Shit, crap, poop, caca, diarrhea, feces, excrement, stool, dung, manure, number two, the big one. Its name changes because it has many roles and context in society. It is on the sidewalks outside and in the everyday language we use and is always in some form or another literally inside all of us. But once we see it, we want to make it disappear. We avoid it, despise it, fear it, use it, laugh at it, and apparently learn from it. Shit is our point of examination.
