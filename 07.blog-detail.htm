<strong>What lead you to your interest in Graphic Design?</strong>
</p>
<p> <em>Erin</em>
          : When I first got into graphic design, I thought I would enjoy making really beautiful, visually interesting pieces. When I look back, that’s only the start; now, I find the most inspiring piece to be the way that we, as designers, can act as problem solvers and strategists to initiate change and action.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Kristin</em>
          :&nbsp;My interest in graphic design started when I learned how to hand-code HTML and design my own website in high school. Once I learned you could make that happen and make a career out of it, the rest was history! My point of view has changed considerably over my time in the real world, but what I find inspiring about this field is that we are in a phase where design is evolving to become more than just a pretty picture – it also needs to be intelligent, strategic, and has to solve more problems than ever. My passion is to make that type of design available to others without reducing the value of what we do. That’s the main reason why I balance my time with pro-bono projects I’m passionate about.

          <em>Erin</em>
          : On top of finishing up my 2-year Presidential term with the AIGA Austin chapter, I’ve currently been in the process of starting up my own small business.&nbsp;After 8 1/2 years of working in agencies with regional and global clients, I chose to work for myself after a round of layoffs; a year later, as business was booming, I chose to make the plunge and turn it into a formal business!
        </p>
        <p>
          The company’s focus is to provide design, marketing, branding and consulting services for startups, small businesses and nonprofits who need a strong start but can’t necessarily afford the larger agencies. We currently have four clients on the roster and are adding one-off projects every month!
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Kristin</em>
          :&nbsp;I currently work full time as an Interactive Art Director at a global marketing agency called AdPeople Worldwide. Our hubs are located in Austin, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Dhaka. I also work on pro-bono work for TEDxAustin and Dogtoberfest Austin. Ever since I started working for AdPeople, my role has continually evolved to where it is now. I’ve had the chance to be on teams for some great pitch projects, and my hope is that I continue to have the opportunity to work on our new business opportunities. I enjoy working face-to-face with prospective clients and being able to showcase the value of design.
